# R course files (stand alone)

The contained files are a standalone version of the bioinformatics are course taught at the University of Bristol. These act as a standalone introduction covering the installation of our through to fitting generalise linear mixed effects models. These are unchanged from the 2021 versions taught in class and so some of the information may not be relevant for other users (E.G.homework).
